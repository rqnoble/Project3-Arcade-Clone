To play the game open index.html in your browser.

Use the arrow keys to move you player.
Navigate this poor player trapped in a this
beautiful 5x6 grid directly into the water as 
much as your heart so desires.

Don't worry the player won't drowned.  The 
player will be immediately and safely teleported 
back where she started as if nothing happened.

Lucky for you you get to keep doing this over 
and over, infinitely!! If you hit any of the
red bugs 4 times you will be cursed; turned 
t stone.  The only way to break the curse is
by following the magic instructions that have
appeared in the waters before you.

Your score will be recorded if it is the first 
score or higher than any score you have 
attained up to this point.

Good luck!
